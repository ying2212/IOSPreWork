## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
While building the app, a challenge arose when attempting to connect the button in the storyboard to the changeBackgroundColor method in the ViewController.swift file. Despite following the correct steps for establishing the connection, the button's tap event did not trigger the intended logic to change the background color.
In response to the challenge faced,I made a decision which to create a new Xcode project. This approach involves starting fresh with a new project structure, ensuring that any potential misconfigurations or issues from the previous project are eliminated.
By creating a new project and carefully following the steps for connecting the button to the logic in the new project, the button's tap event successfully triggered the intended background color change. This solution not only resolved the specific issue but also provided a clean slate for further development.
